# Let's Go Further - Advanced Go Web Application

This repository contains my implementation of the web application project from *Let's Go Further* by Alex Edwards. Building on the foundations from *Let's Go*, this book delves into advanced Go web development, focusing on creating a robust RESTful API with features like authentication, testing, and database management.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to follow along with *Let's Go Further* and build a sophisticated web application. Key features include:
- RESTful API endpoints for resource management
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Database migrations for schema management
- Unit and integration testing
- Advanced error handling and logging
- Middleware for security and request processing
